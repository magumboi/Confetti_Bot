# Confetti_Bot ðŸ¤–
![License: MIT][ico-license]

This is a forked version of HQ_bot, a bot to help answer questions on trivia games like Confetti, HQ and CashShow. This bot takes screenshot of the game on the phone and uses googles tesseract OCR to read the questions and options. It automates the process of googling of the answers and gives the most likely answer! It is 70%+ accurate!

* Multiprocessing methods were used to make google api calls 2x faster (from about 8.5s to 3.8s). 
* tesseract spanish package were used to read spanish words properly.

Since it is against the policy of HQ-trivia i do not encourage anyone to use this during a live game and this is purely for educational purposes.

* JSON - Data Storage

## Usage

Make sure all packages above are installed. For Android screen mirroring you could use [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) and for iOS, quicktime player. **The code expects the phone to be on the left side of the screen.** If you want to change the screenshot co-ordinates change the values inside the ImageGrab in the `screen_grab()` function. To use the script : 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/magumboi/Confetti_Bot.git
$ cd Confetti_Bot
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python answer_bot.py
Press s to screenshot live game, sampq to run against sample questions or q to quit:
s
...Question...
```

## Special shout out
[Jake Mor][jake-mor] was the person behind HQuack, the most viral popular bot to help solve HQ questions. His implementation inspired me to try my own. I recommend reading this [article][jake-more] to learn more about the whole story.
